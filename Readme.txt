*******************************************************

1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.  
   To uncompress it use the following commands 
       % unzip [homework_filename]

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
        main.cpp
        Quadratic.h
        Quadratic.cpp
        makefile
        readme.txt

2. Build the program.

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd [directory_name] 

    Compile the program by:
    % make

3. Run the program by:
   % ./[file_name]  (e.g., ./clock)

4. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by
   %./make clean
